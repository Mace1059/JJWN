Todo List (ADD AS WE GO)
1. Create Game
 
    a. Quiz Question system
 
        - Question at the top of screen, 4 buttons for answers
 
        - 1 correct, 3 wrong answers
 
            - pulled from other questions/designated ???
            - JV - (Think it would be good to have option for each. Vocab-related games would be easy to set up with answers pulled from other questions (and would be less intensive than having to write in wrong answers for each question, but other types of questions would likely have answers that are obviously unrelated to other questions.)
 
        - Distinct hovering display (color, size, etc)
 
        - Points awarded for quickness
 
        - Questions synchronous or asynchronous ???
        - JV - I think asynchronous would add more action to the game and further reward quickness
 
    b. Ranking component
 
        - Rankings (after _#_ questions/minutes ???)
 
        - Matchups based on rankings for next _#_ questions
 
        - Winner at end has most points
 
        - Winner becomes "team captain," points now added up
 
        - Visualization on host screen
 
    c. Even vs Odd Players
 
        - Need to draw this out !!!
 
    d. Determining winner
 
        - Most points win
 
        - Final battle between top 2/3 teams at the end for _#_ questions/minutes
 
        - Teammates answer questions too
 
        - Tug of war bar display



    Style

        - Round corners

        - Soft font -->

2. Difference between Player/Host
